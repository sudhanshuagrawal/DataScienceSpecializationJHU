##There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. 
##In this dataset, what is the mean of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica?

>sepalen_virginica<-subset(iris,Species=="virginica",select=Sepal.Length)

>sapply(sepalen_virginica,mean)


##Continuing with the 'iris' dataset from the previous Question, what R code returns a vector of the means of 
##the variables 'Sepal.Length', 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', and 'Petal.Width'?

>apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)

##How can one calculate the average miles per gallon (mpg) by number of cylinders in the car (cyl)? Select all that apply.

>tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)

>with(mtcars, tapply(mpg, cyl, mean))

>sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)

##Continuing with the 'mtcars' dataset from the previous Question, 
##what is the absolute difference between the average horsepower of 4-cylinder 
##cars and the average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars?

> hp4avg<-subset(mtcars,cyl==4,select=hp)
> hp8avg<-subset(mtcars,cyl==8,select =hp)

>hp4<-sapply(hp4avg,mean)
> hp8<-sapply(hp8avg,mean)
> hp4-hp8
       hp
